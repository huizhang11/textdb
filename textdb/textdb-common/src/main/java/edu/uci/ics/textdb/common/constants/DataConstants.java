     * KeywordMatchingType: the type of keyword matching to perform. <br>
     * Currently we have 3 types of keyword matching: <br>
     * 
     * SUBSTRING_SCANBASED: <br>
     * Performs simple substring matching of the query. SubString matching is
     * case insensitive. Source tuples are provided by ScanSourceOperator. <br>
     * 
     * CONJUNCTION_INDEXBASED: <br>
     * Performs search of conjunction of query tokens. The query is tokenized
     * into keywords, with each token treated as a separate keyword. The order
     * of tokens doesn't matter in the source tuple. <br>
     * 
     * For example: <br>
     * query "book appointment" <br>
     * matches: "book appointment with the doctor" <br>
     * also matches: "an appointment to pick up a book" <br>
     * <br>
     * 
     * 
     * PHRASE_INDEXBASED: <br>
     * Performs a phrase search. The query is tokenized into keywords, with
     * stopwords treated as placeholders. The order of tokens matters in the
     * source tuple. A stopword matches an arbitary token. <br>
     * 
     * For example: <br>
     * query "book appointment" <br>
     * matches: "book appointment with the doctor" <br>
     * doesn't match: "an appointment to pick up book" <br>
     * 
     * Example of stopword as placeholders: <br>
     * query "nice a a person": matches "nice and beautiful person" <br>
     * matches "nice gentle honest person" <br>
     * doesn't match "nice person" <br>
     * doesn't match "nice gentle person" <br>
     * <br>
     * 
     * Default list of stopwords: in
     * org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer: <br>
     * StandardAnalyzer.STOP_WORDS_SET which includes:
     * 
     * but, be, with, such, then, for, no, will, not, are, and, their, if, this,
     * on, into, a, or, there, in, that, they, was, is, it, an, the, as, at,
     * these, by, to, of
